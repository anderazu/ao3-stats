Exploratory plots and poking at the big AO3 stats dump posted [here](https://archiveofourown.org/admin_posts/18804). 

I've omitted the data files, because it seemed unneighborly to drop ~2 GB of text on Github that's available elsewhere (at the link). But if you download the `.csv` files and drop them in a `data` folder off your project directory, everything should work.
